## Features

I predominantly made use of HTML, CSS (without bootstrap), and a host of JS tools. The latter includes objects, conditional statements and DOM manipulation. 

The objective I had at the beginning was to create a game that was not only simply to play/understand, but would be 'addictive' in the sense of drawing the user back to the game after a loss against the computer.
